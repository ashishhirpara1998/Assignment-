    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error occurs, Python generates an exception object to represent the error condition. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as invalid input, division by zero, file not found, and so on. Python provides a mechanism for handling exceptions using try, except, finally, and raise statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exception:\n",
    "    1. An exception is a runtime error that occurs when a program is executing. \n",
    "    2. It typically happens due to logical errors, unexpected conditions, or              invalid     inputs during the execution of the program.\n",
    "    3. Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, ValueError,          FileNotFoundError, etc.\n",
    "    4. Exceptions can be handled using try, except, finally, and raise statements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Syntax Error:\n",
    "    1. A syntax error is a compile-time error that occurs when the syntax of the          code violates the rules of the programming language.\n",
    "    2. It usually happens due to mistakes such as misspelled keywords, missing or        misplaced punctuation, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "    3. Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed and must be fixed            before running the program.\n",
    "    4. Examples of syntax errors include missing colons at the end of if, elif,          else, for, while, etc., statements, missing parentheses, incorrect                indentation, etc."

    "1. try: The try statement is used to enclose the code block that may raise an             exception. It allows you to define a block of code in which exceptions may         occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. except: The except statement is used to catch and handle specific exceptions              that occur within the corresponding try block. You can have multiple              except blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. else: The else statement is optional and is used to define a block of code that          will be executed if no exceptions occur in the corresponding try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. finally: The finally statement is also optional and is used to define a block               of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception                   occurs in the try block. This block is typically used for cleanup                 operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",

    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exception classes that inherit from built-in exception classes like Exception or its subclasses. These exceptions are created to handle specific error conditions or exceptional situations in a program that are not covered by the built-in exceptions provided by Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions in Python for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Semantic Clarity: Custom exceptions allow developers to define and use                              exception names that are meaningful and descriptive in the                        context of their application or domain. This makes the code                        more readable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Error Differentiation: Custom exceptions enable finer-grained error handling by                           allowing developers to distinguish between different                               types of errors or exceptional situations. This can help                           in implementing targeted error recovery strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modularity and Reusability: By encapsulating error handling logic within custom                                exception classes, developers can promote                                          modularity and reusability of their code. Custom                                  exceptions can be reused across different parts of                                the application or even in different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging and Troubleshooting: Custom exceptions provide more specific error                                     messages and context information, which can be                                     helpful during debugging and troubleshooting.                                     They make it easier to pinpoint the root cause                                     of an error and take appropriate corrective                                       actions."
